Best answers to short Wyncode questions!

This is a stock ticker web scraping program. 
Every time you run it, you should get the current price for AAPL.
I added some additional features:
- Format the price to look like a money value.
- Allow the user to specify a stock symbol.
- Display additional data about the stock, like the previous close price.
